>Happy new year, guys.
Never ask me about the scrollbar on my blog. I just don't know why it's color looks like this. :)

Anyway.

I like [sidelegend](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/ "From Bottle") alike effects so much. So I just plagiarized from Bottle.

But, oops. The octopress used library [Ender.js](http://ender.no.de/ A brief intro) which just overwrite the *$*.

So, I plan to port(maybe should use such a big verb) *sidelegend*.

No big job, not a lot of codes.

I will post the code to my [ github ](https://github.comm/liaowang11).

<h2 id="Done">
<a class="headerlink"></a>Ok, It's done.

check out [sidelegend](https://github.com/liaowang11/sidelegend).

BTW, it's really easy to get confused about **$(this)** and **this**.

Next time, tell you some thing about _Microsoft Asia Research_..
