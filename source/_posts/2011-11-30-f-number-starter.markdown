Recently, i'm so absorbed in Haskell and tried hard to understand the <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/11au-cs240h/">lectures from stanford</a>.
I like Haskell, I have to say. It seems to make things more obvious and safe to do. Though, sometimes the high level abstraction may kill your guts.

While interested in functional programming, I start reading "Lambda-Calculus and Combinators, an Introduction" by J.Roger Hindley, which is recommended by <a href="http://matt.might.net/#teaching">Matt Might</a>. He is a such a teacher, though I never got the privilege to be his students. :)

So here, with win$ platform, F# seems to be the best language to study and also recommended a lot on StackOverFlow for someone who is familiar with .NET.
This post is just for recording my learning experience with this language.

Just a brief overview of this language. F# is often compared with Ocaml
