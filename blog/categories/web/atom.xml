    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I read a post about <a href="http://www.nirgoldshlager.com/2013/02/how-i-hacked-facebook-oauth-to-get-full.html">Facebook Oauth Flaws</a>. The post is
interesting, so I can't resist to give it a try on some other services
leveraging Oauth. And the most popular one in China should undoubtedly
be <a href="http://weibo.com">Sina Weibo</a>.</p>

<h2>Sina Weibo Oauth</h2>

<p>The entry point to oauth can be located at
<a href="https://api.weibo.com/oauth2">here</a>. The developer center gave a
overview of the oauth workflow.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.sinaimg.cn/blog/developer/wiki/oAuth2_02.gif" alt="Oauth code authentication flow" /></p>

<h2>Insite App Authentication</h2>

<p>Take <a href="http://apps.weibo.com/guanjia">guanjia</a> as an example. The
authentication url is here:</p>

<pre><code>https://api.weibo.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&amp;client_id=1567453627&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.weibo.com/guanjia.
</code></pre>

<h3>Ass Kicked</h3>

<p>After I read the Oauth Protocol, I tried very hard to find the access
token return by posting to the <strong>redirect_uri</strong>. But the response
return after confirm the authentication is merely a line of
javascript:
```javascript</p>

<script type="text/javascript">top.location.href="http://apps.weibo.com/guanjia";</script>


<p>```
There is no <strong>Access Token</strong>! What the hell.</p>

<p>Later on, I discovered because this is an insite app, which sharing
the same domain as apps.weibo.com. That is to say the page is still
returned by Sina, not posting to <strong>redirect_uri</strong>.</p>

<p>At last, an <code>iframe</code> embedded in that page is the real page get posted
to. The <strong>Access Token</strong> is named <strong>signed_request</strong>.</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<pre><code>https://api.weibo.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&amp;client_id=1567453627&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.weibo.com/guanjia
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>client_id</strong> in the url is unique to every app. You have to
register a developer account and propose to get your app&amp;secret key and
get assigned a <strong>client_id</strong>.</p>

<p>What we are focusing here is <strong>redirect_uri</strong> which the essence of
<a href="http://www.nirgoldshlager.com/2013/02/how-i-hacked-facebook-oauth-to-get-full.html">Nir Goldshlager</a> article. The problem about
<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> is that it does not check enough
or maybe potentially omitted it's own subdomain.</p>

<h3>Sina Offical Apps</h3>

<p>I checked the url above, but actually didn't found the same issue.
IMHO, sina official apps are treated totally different, each owning a
different subdomain. And redirecting to the subdomains doesn't work,
which result in a very obvious error:</p>

<blockquote><p>error:redirect_uri_mismatch</p></blockquote>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>A follow-up post about <a href="http://www.nirgoldshlager.com/2013/03/how-i-hacked-any-facebook-accountagain.html">Facebook Oauth</a> stated that facebook fixed
the problem by fixing or using regular expression matching. It's easy
to see Sina also uses regular expression to check the
<strong>redirect_uri</strong>.</p>

<p>What I found out are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Numbers are not checked. That is to say appending numbers to the
url passes the check and the page get redirect to an error page, which
in most circumstances cannot be found. But I don't think Sina will
approve a new app name which is mostly the same with another.:)</li>
<li>In fact, at first I'm not so familiar with <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth Protocol</a>. In
sum, the flows examined here is not as severe as I thought. When
requesting access to resources, it needs to provide <strong>app secret_id</strong>
as well as the <strong>access token</strong>. The two are tied. So even if one can manage to steal
your <strong>access token</strong>, without <strong>secret_id</strong> it poses no threats.</li>
</ol>
